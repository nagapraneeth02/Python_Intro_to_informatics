    "Time Complexity: Because the function recursively calls itself twice with smaller inputs until it reaches the base cases, the time complexity of the preceding code is exponential with respect to the input size n. Each recursive call branches into two further calls, resulting in a binary tree with depth n of recursive calls. As a result, the number of function calls increases exponentially with n, yielding a temporal complexity of O(2^n). For big values of n, this can be computationally expensive because the number of function calls and time necessary to compute the result grows rapidly. Nonetheless, for small values of n, the function can be quickly executed."
